<h2>Siberian Husky</h2>
<p>While I am a lover of many animals, there is one species and breed that has always stood out to me and that is the siberian husky. Majestic, playful, energetic, loyal, the siberian husky is a beautiful and gallant animal that is both aestically and behaviorly pleasing to interact with. The Siberian husky has many great qualities such as below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Energetic</li>
	<li>Playful</li>
	<li>Courageous</li>
	<li>Social</li>
	<li>Athletic</li>
	<li>Intelligent</li>
	<li>Independent</li>
	<li>Good around children</li>
</ul>
<p>While they have many positive qualities, they are not easy to raise due their stubborn nature and hierarchical needs. If a novice dog owner/trainer wants to own or train one, they will need to consider the following.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Stubborn</li>
	<li>Hierarchical</li>
	<li>Require alot of attention both socially and physically</li>
	<li>Can be destructive if not properly cared for</li>
</ul>
